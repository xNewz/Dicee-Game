# Dicee Game

## Description
This is a simple dice game that I made while learning the basics of JavaScript. The game is random and the dice will roll when the page is refreshed.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.
3. Refresh the page to roll the dice.
4. Refresh the page again to roll the dice again.
